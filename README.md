# Pokedex

A simple program made in python/javascript with the module Eel for python, just to learn how to make a gui for python applications. This little project was used to learn a bit of web scrapping, HTML, CSS and Javascript as I had zero experience in those languages before starging the project.

<h2>To do</h2>

I have to do some layout tweaks, like adjusting some buttons and fonts and the layout of the max stats tooltips. I still need to adjust the moveset_db as we have the movesets from Ultra Sun/Moon and Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee unlabeled, I will check and label them properly in the future (or use the ones in the next generation games, maybe).

I still need to refactor a lot of things, add better comments, specially in the CSS file.

Maybe I will update the project to use a real database (mongodb??) or in node.js.

<h2>Resources</h2>

All information and images collected in the databases are from <a>https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net</a> and <a>https://pokemondb.net</a>, both excellent sources for pokemon material and the move info was extracted from <a>https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/3ds/213054-pokemon-ultra-sun-and-pokemon-ultra-moon-veteran-trainers/faqs/75354/pokemon-move-list</a>.

# Pokedex

A simple Electron-like program using the Eel module for python, SQLite in a SPA with pure JS.

A simple program made in python/javascript with the module Eel for python, just to learn how to make a gui for python
applications. This little project was used to learn a bit of web scrapping, HTML, CSS and Javascript as I had zero
experience in those languages before starting the project.

In last version I changed everything to add the data in a proper SQLite database and OOP. Started to play with Greensock
animations, but I need a deep dive in this library to get the hang of it.

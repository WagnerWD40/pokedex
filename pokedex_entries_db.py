Instead, it relies on its ultrasonic cries for echolocation to flit about in darkness.', 'Zubat remains quietly unmoving in a dark spot during the bright daylight hours. It does so because prolonged exposure to the sun causes its body to become slightly burned.', 'Zubat avoids sunlight because exposure causes it to become unhealthy. During the daytime, it stays in caves or under the eaves of old houses, sleeping while hanging upside down.', 'It sleeps in caves during the day. It has no eyes, so to check its surroundings while flying, it emits ultrasonic waves.', 'When exposed to sunlight, they suffer burns. The frequency of their ultrasonic waves can differ slightly from colony to colony.', 'It has no eyeballs, so it can’t see. It checks its surroundings via the ultrasonic waves it emits from its mouth.', 'Their skin is so thin that they’ll be burned if sunlight hits them. When it gets cold out, they gather together to warm one another’s bodies.', 'Emits ultrasonic cries while it flies. They act as a sonar used to check for objects in its way.'],
"Zweilous":['After it has eaten up all the food in its territory, it moves to another area. Its two heads do not get along.', 'Since their two heads do not get along and compete with each other for food, they always eat too much.', 'The two heads do not get along.

"Zygarde":['When the Kalos region’s ecosystem falls into disarray, it appears and reveals its secret power.', 'It’s hypothesized that it’s monitoring those who destroy the ecosystem from deep in the cave where it lives.', 'This is Zygarde’s form when it has gathered 50% of its cells. It wipes out all those who oppose it, showing not a shred of mercy.', 'It’s thought to be monitoring the ecosystem. There are rumors that even greater power lies hidden within it.', 'This is Zygarde’s form when about half of its pieces have been assembled. It plays the role of monitoring the ecosystem.', 'Some say it can change to an even more powerful form when battling those who threaten the ecosystem.', 'Its sharp fangs make short work of finishing off its enemies, but it’s unable to maintain this body indefinitely. After a period of time, it falls apart.', 'This is Zygarde’s form when about 10% of its cells have been gathered. It runs across the land at speeds greater than 60 mph.', 'This is Zygarde when about 10% of its pieces have been assembled. It leaps at its opponent’s chest and sinks its sharp fangs into them.', 'Born when around 10% of Zygarde’s cells have been gathered from all over, this form is skilled in close-range combat.', 'This is Zygarde’s form at times when it uses its overwhelming power to suppress those who endanger the ecosystem.', 'This is Zygarde’s 100% form. It has enough power to overwhelm even Xerneas or Yveltal.', 'This is Zygarde’s perfected form. From the orifice on its chest, it radiates high-powered energy that eliminates everything.', 'Born when all of Zygarde’s cells have been gathered together, it uses force to neutralize those who harm the ecosystem.'],
